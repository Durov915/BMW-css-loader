## How to Use üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Download or Clone the Repository:**
   - First, download the code files for the BMW loader from the GitHub repository or clone the repository using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/durov915/BMW-css-loader.git
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file from the repository and extract it on your local machine.

2. **Copy HTML and CSS Files:**
   - Once you have the files, copy the `index.html` and `bmvstyle.css` files into your project directory.

3. **Link CSS File:**
   - In your HTML file where you want to integrate the loader, add a link to the `bmvstyle.css` file in the `<head>` section:
     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/bmvstyle.css">
     ```
   - Replace `"path/to/bmvstyle.css"` with the correct path to the CSS file within your project directory.

4. **Place Loader HTML Code:**
   - Place the HTML code for the loader where you want it to appear in your website's HTML structure:
     ```html
     <div id="loader" class="loader">
         <!-- Loader HTML code goes here -->
     </div>
     ```

5. **Display Loader Initially:**
   - By default, the loader is set to be displayed when the page is loading. If you want to show the loader initially and hide it after the page loads, you can use JavaScript to hide it:
     ```html
     <script>
         let loader = document.getElementById("loader");
         window.addEventListener("load", () => {
             loader.style.display = "none";
         });
     </script>
     ```

6. **Adjust Loader Position and Size (Optional):**
   - You can adjust the position and size of the loader by modifying the CSS properties in the `bmvstyle.css` file according to your website's layout and design requirements.

7. **Test the Integration:**
   - Finally, test your website to ensure that the BMW loader appears and functions as expected.

By following these steps, you can easily integrate the BMW loader into your website and enhance the user experience with a stylish loading animation inspired by the BMW logo.
